AirportCRUDGUI is a Java GUI application developed in NetBeans that manages airport passenger check-in data. The system supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for passengers and check-in locations.
Users can:

Add, view, update, and delete passenger records (ID, name, check-in location, time).

Track which passengers checked in, where, and when.

Maintain a log of check-in locations and associated passenger IDs.

The intuitive graphical interface makes it easy to manage and view airport check-in data efficiently.
